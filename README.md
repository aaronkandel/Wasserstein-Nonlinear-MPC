# Wasserstein-Nonlinear-MPC

This is the code corresponding to the case studies in the following paper:

Aaron Kandel and Scott Moura, "Safe Learning MPC with Limited Model Knowledge and Data,"  conditionally accepted to IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology.

This script requires the MATLAB deep learning toolbox. Python versions will be available soon!

Note: Sometimes the AV example will ''false start'' and not moe appreciably from the initial point. This is a potential issue in model training, but occurs infrequently. If that scenario occurs, feel free to restart the simulation.
